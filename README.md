# Dimensionality Reduction and Classification on Colon Cancer data 

> In this notebook we work with the `colon.csv` file, which contains gene data from each patient. The dataset includes various gene expression measurements (features) and a label indicating the stage information.
> We apply PCA and KPCA to this real-world data for dimensionality reduction and classification.
